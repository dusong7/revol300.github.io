# Introduction
Q. Waht is a web application?
A. A web (based) application is any program that is accessed over a network connection using HTTP, rather than existing within a device's memory.

making web apps
1. Build your App
2. Pack it for shipping
3. Host or Run the App

we are going to using a nginx.

# Web-apps Problem
Way too many of them and still growing
"But it worked on my machine!" issues
Faster Updates due to growth of DevOps
Abundance of Data
Wide use VMs

# Container
Containers are an abstraction at the Application layer that packages codes and dependencies together

hypervisor , docker host os picture~~~

Containers ...
Consumes less storage and memeory
Easier and faster to ship
If they work on one machine; they work on all machines
Cost efficient and easy to sacle
Possible to eliminate data loss and downtime

# Introducing Docker
Docker is an open platform for developers and system admins to build, ship and run containerized applications.

- Most widely used Containerization platform
- Huge comments:munity support
- Large amount of 3rd party application support
- Works on Windows and Mac too

Dockerfile(build) => DockerImage(ship) => containers(Run)

#Docker Architecture
Docker Client = > interaction with client
Docker CLI ex.) docker run, docker pull
Docker API ex.) client.container.run, client.container.pull

Docker Host => actually performing part

Docker Registry => store docker images 

Docker Client         Docker Host        Docker Registry
         API calls, Result         Images
