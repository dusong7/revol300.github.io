# Introduction
Q. Waht is a web application?
A. A web (based) application is any program that is accessed over a network connection using HTTP, rather than existing within a device's memory.

making web apps
1. Build your App
2. Pack it for shipping
3. Host or Run the App

we are going to using a nginx.

# Web-apps Problem
Way too many of them and still growing
"But it worked on my machine!" issues
Faster Updates due to growth of DevOps
Abundance of Data
Wide use VMs

# Container
Containers are an abstraction at the Application layer that packages codes and dependencies together

hypervisor , docker host os picture~~~

Containers ...
Consumes less storage and memeory
Easier and faster to ship
If they work on one machine; they work on all machines
Cost efficient and easy to sacle
Possible to eliminate data loss and downtime

# Introducing Docker
Docker is an open platform for developers and system admins to build, ship and run containerized applications.

- Most widely used Containerization platform
- Huge comments:munity support
- Large amount of 3rd party application support
- Works on Windows and Mac too

Dockerfile(build) => DockerImage(ship) => containers(Run)

#Docker Architecture
Docker Client = > interaction with client
Docker CLI ex.) docker run, docker pull
Docker API ex.) client.container.run, client.container.pull

Docker Host => actually performing part

Docker Registry => store docker images 

Docker Client         Docker Host        Docker Registry
         API calls, Result         Images

#Dockerfile
A sequential set of instruction for Docker Engine
Primary way of interacting with Docker
Order of sequence is important!
Each instruction creates a layer
Layers can be cached and reused by Docker

##Docker file structure
### Fundamental Instruction

```
ARG CODE_VERSION=16.04

FROM ubuntu:${CODE_VERSION}

RUN apt-get update -y

CMD ["bash"]
```

### Configuration Instruction

```
FROM ubuntu:16.04

LABEL Creator: "Cerulean Canvas"

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl \
    && apt-get clean \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

RUN mkdir /home/Codes

ENV USER Cerulean-Canvas
ENV SHELL /bin/bash
ENV LOGNAME Cerulean-Canvas

CMD ["bash"]
```

### Expose Instruction

```
FROM ubuntu:16.04

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install nginx -y \
    && apt-get clean \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

EXPOSE 80

CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]

```

# Docker Images
A stack of multiple layers created from Dockerfile Instructions
Each layer apart from the top one is R/O
The top player is R/W type
Recognized by name order Image ID
They are pushed to and can be pulled from Docker Hub


# Container

Running instance of a Docker ImageProvides similar isolation to VMs but lighter ... A LOT LIGHTER!
Adds writable layer on top of image layers and works on it
Can talk to other containers like processes instructions Linux
Uses Copy-on-Write

# Docker Netweork Driver
Piece of software that enables networking of containers
Responsible for invoking a network inside the host or within the cluster
Native n/w drivers are shipped with Docker Engine
Remote n/w drivers are created and managed by 3rd party vendors or community
IP Address Management Drivers provide default subnets if not specified by admin
